# Program that takes the base and height of a triangle as input and calculates its area, storing the result in a variable.

base = int(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

area_of_triangle = (base * height) / 2

print("The area of the triangle is:", area_of_triangle)
